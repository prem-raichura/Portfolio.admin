# Portfolio Backend

A production-ready multi-tenant Portfolio backend platform where users can register, manage their portfolio data, and access their own public APIs dynamically.

---

# 🚀 What is this?

This project is a complete backend infrastructure for a Portfolio platform.

The idea behind this system is:

- Every user can register on the platform
- Every user gets their own portfolio management dashboard
- Users can manage:
  - Projects
  - Certificates
  - Experience
  - Hero Section
  - Skills
  - Portfolio Links
- Every user's data becomes publicly accessible through dynamic APIs
- Frontend portfolio websites can fetch portfolio data dynamically from this backend

This backend acts like a centralized portfolio data engine.

---

# 🌍 Real World Use Case

Suppose:

A user registers with:

```bash
username = premraichura
```

Then the backend automatically provides public APIs like:

```bash
GET /api/public/
```

Frontend portfolio websites can use this API to dynamically fetch and display portfolio data.

This means:

- The portfolio website becomes dynamic
- User updates portfolio data from admin panel
- Public website updates automatically through APIs

# ⚡ Features

## Authentication System

- JWT Authentication
- Access Tokens
- Refresh Tokens
- Secure Login System
- Protected Routes

---

## Portfolio Management

Users can manage:

- Hero Section
- Projects
- Certificates
- Experience
- Skills
- Social Links

---

## API Key System

Users can generate API Keys.

Example:

```bash
x-api-key: USER_API_KEY
```

Used for:
- Public portfolio APIs
- External integrations
- Portfolio frontend fetching

---

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

Each user only accesses:
- their own data
- their own logs
- their own analytics

---

## Analytics System

Tracks:
- Portfolio views
- API usage
- Requests count
- Performance metrics

---

## Logging System

Stores:
- Route
- Method
- Request data
- Response data
- Status code
- IP Address
- Response time

Logs are:
- asynchronous
- queue-based
- user-wise isolated

---

## Queue System

Using:
- BullMQ
- Redis

Workers:
- Logs Worker
- Analytics Worker

---

## Cloudinary Uploads

Supports:
- Project Images
- Certificate Images
- Portfolio Assets

---

## Dockerized Infrastructure

Complete Docker support:
- Backend container
- PostgreSQL container
- Redis container

---

## Production Deployment

Successfully deployed on:

- Render
- PostgreSQL Cloud DB
- Redis Cloud

# 🔐 Authentication Flow

## Login Flow

```text

↓
Generate Access Token
↓
Generate Refresh Token
↓
Frontend stores tokens
```

---

## Access Token

- Short expiry
- Used for API authentication

---

## Refresh Token

- Long expiry
- Generates new access token automatically

---

# 🌐 Public API System

The platform provides dynamic public APIs for every registered user.

Instead of exposing usernames directly in routes, the system uses secure API Keys.

Each registered user receives their own API Key which is used to access their public portfolio data.

---

# 🔑 Public API Authentication

Public APIs use:

```bash
x-api-key
```

inside request headers.

Example:

```bash
x-api-key: USER_API_KEY
```

---

# 📡 Public Portfolio API

## Endpoint

```bash
GET /api/public
```

---

# 📌 Example Request

```javascript
fetch(
  "https://your-api.com/api/public",
  {
    headers: {
      "x-api-key":
        "USER_API_KEY"
    }
  }
)
```

---

# 📌 Example Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "user": {
    "name": "Prem Raichura",
    "projects": [],
    "certificates": [],
    "skills": [],
    "hero": {},
    "experience": []
  }
}
```

---

# 👤 How User Data Works

## Step 1 — User Generates API Key

The backend generates a unique API Key for the user.

Example:

```bash
x-api-key: USER_API_KEY
```

This API Key uniquely identifies the portfolio owner.

---

## Step 2 — Public API Access

Frontend portfolio websites call:

```bash
GET /api/public
```

using:

```bash
x-api-key
```

header authentication.

# 📌 Example Frontend Fetch

```javascript
const response =
  await fetch(
    "https://your-api.com/api/public",
    {
      headers: {
        "x-api-key":
          "USER_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  );

const data =
  await response.json();
```

---

# 🔒 Why API Keys Are Used

Using API Keys provides:

- secure public access
- user identification
- rate limiting
- analytics tracking
- multi-tenant isolation
- scalable API architecture

without exposing internal user authentication tokens.
